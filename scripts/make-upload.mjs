// permissions, and cPanel's extractor then creates directories their own
// owner cannot read. The result is a site that 503s with

// perfectly good. This writes explicit permissions into every entry
// (directories 755, files 644), so the extracted tree is correct on any host.

//   npm run pack          → ./upload.zip

// Run it after `npm run build`. It refuses to run without a build, and it
// never includes .env.local, node_modules, or the build cache.
