//
// Applies every migration in ./drizzle that this database has not seen yet.
//
// This exists because `drizzle-kit migrate` could not do it. Drizzle tracks
// migrations through a journal it writes itself (drizzle/meta/_journal.json);
// where the .sql files are hand-written, there is no journal, and the command
// finds nothing to apply — then exits 0. A migration tool that reports success
// while doing nothing is worse than one that fails, because the deploy goes
// green and the schema silently stays behind until a page 500s on a column
// that was never added.
//
// The rules this runner holds itself to:
//
//   • Each file applies inside a transaction. A statement that fails rolls the
//     whole file back — the alternative is a half-created schema that neither
//     re-runs nor works.
//   • What ran is recorded in `cms_migrations`, so a second run is a no-op and
//     a partial deploy can be resumed.
//   • It says what it did, every time. "Nothing to do" is only ever printed
//     when the files really are all applied.
//   • Any failure exits non-zero, so a deploy that runs this stops.
//
// The work itself lives in apply-migrations.cjs, which server.js also runs at
// startup — so on the host this command is only needed when the automatic run
// reported a failure in startup.log.
