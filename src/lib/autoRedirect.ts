 * still ran first — redirects are checked before pages — and the new
 * document could not be reached, with nothing in the admin saying why. The
 * rule is switched off rather than deleted, so one an administrator wrote by
 * hand is still there on the Redirects screen to see and re-enable.

 * Takes whole paths rather than a slug and a `"/blog"` prefix. A post's URL is
 * whatever the permalink structure says it is — it may carry a date, or be an
 * id under `/archives` — so only the caller can say where the post used to
 * live. Passing a slug and gluing `/blog` on the front wrote a redirect for a
 * URL the post had not lived at since permalinks became a setting, and left
 * the address people actually had bookmarked pointing at a 404.
