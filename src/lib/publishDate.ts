 *     empty) has no publish date; clearing it is what "unpublish" means.
 *   • A status-only change — the list's bulk "Switch to draft", which sends no
 *     date at all — keeps the date. Clearing it there meant a later bulk
 *     Publish stamped today, and a years-old article jumped to the top of
 *     the blog, the feed and the sitemap as if it were new.
 *   • An already-published document keeps the date it had, so re-saving does
 *     not silently move it to today.
 *   • Publishing for the first time with no date given stamps now.
