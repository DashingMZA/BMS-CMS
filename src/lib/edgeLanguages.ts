// any route runs — `/fr/about` is French, `/about` is the default language, and
// `/frames` is a page slug that merely starts with the same letters. That
// decision needs the configured list, and middleware cannot import
// `getSiteSettings` (it pulls in Drizzle and the whole schema).
//
// Same shape as `redirects.ts`: one lazy client, the answer cached in module
// scope behind a short TTL, so the per-request cost is an array lookup rather
// than a query.

// See `redirects.ts` for why this goes through `rawQuery` rather than its own
// Neon client: a direct client only works on Neon, and its failure mode was a
// site that silently served every language as the default.
