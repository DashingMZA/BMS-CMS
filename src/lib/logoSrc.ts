// they are shown; the logo was a plain `<img>` of the original file, so every
// visitor downloaded 14 KiB to paint a 98px mark, and Lighthouse said so
// ("Improve image delivery"). This asks the optimiser for the two sizes a
// 1× and 2× screen actually need. `src` stays the original file: the
// customizer swaps it live by setting `img.src`, and a browser with no
// srcset support falls back to it.
