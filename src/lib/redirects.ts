 * turns the per-request cost into a Map lookup. A miss costs one query per
 * instance per TTL window, not one per request.
 *
 * Middleware runs in its own runtime, so `invalidateRedirects()` called from an
 * API route cannot reach this cache — the two do not share memory. The TTL is
 * therefore the real propagation delay for a new rule, and is kept short.
 * One query per instance per window is negligible; a stale minute is not.
 *
 * Sixty seconds, for the same reason as edgeLanguages.ts: a rule changes
 * rarely, and every refresh is a round trip to a database that may be in
 * another country. Stale-while-revalidate means no visitor waits for it.

/**
 * Trailing slashes, case and percent-encoding shouldn't decide whether a

 *
 * The encoding half was missing and it broke redirects entirely for every
 * non-Latin URL. A browser sends `/%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A9`, but both
 * sources of rules store the decoded text: `recordSlugChange` builds its path
 * from the raw slug, and an administrator types `/مدونة` into the form. The
 * two forms never met, so renaming an Arabic post left the old URL a 404 and
 * a hand-written Arabic redirect simply never fired.
 *
 * Decoding here fixes both directions at once, because stored sources run
 * through this function too — so a rule saved in either form still matches.
 *
 * `decodeURI`, not `decodeURIComponent`: it is the exact inverse of the
 * `encodeURI` used elsewhere and leaves the reserved characters alone, so a
 * literal `%2F` in a path stays a `%2F` rather than turning into a separator
 * and changing the shape of the path.
 *
 * Lowercasing after decoding also stops `%D9` becoming `%d9`, which is what
 * made non-Latin paths show up as lowercase escape codes in the 404 log.

 * applied whatever it was given, so a perfectly good rule could be edited into
 * a self-redirect, or its source changed to "/", after the fact.
