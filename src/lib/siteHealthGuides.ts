// link was missing on half of them and the other half assumed the reader
// knew which screen and which field. This is the missing half: every check id
// maps to the screen that fixes it and the steps to take there. The checks
// stay focused on *detecting*; the guide is looked up by id when the report
// is assembled, so a check never has to repeat it.
