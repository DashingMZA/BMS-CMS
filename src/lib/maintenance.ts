// Database housekeeping — the rows that only ever grow.
//
// A trash that is never emptied, an error log nobody prunes, a 404 log that
// remembers every bot probe from two years ago: none of it breaks anything,
// but on a free-tier database it is the difference between 20 MB and the
// 500 MB cap, and it makes every backup bigger. WordPress does the same job
// with "empty trash after 30 days" and a handful of clean-up plugins.
//
// Two halves: `previewCleanup` counts what would go (shown in Site Health) and
// `runCleanup` deletes it. The publish cron runs the second once a day, and
// the Site Health button runs it on demand. Nothing here touches content
// that is live, drafted or scheduled — only trash past its keep time and logs.

 * Once per site: puts every non-administrator's stored content through the

 * saved before it existed are still stored with their scripts, and render
 * that way until someone edits the document. This re-saves exactly those
 * documents' content, filtered; everything else is left untouched, and a
 * flag makes it a one-off.
 *
 * "Whose content" is the person who last *saved* it, not the document's
 * current author. An administrator adding a tracking snippet to an editor's
 * post is the owner's call, and judging by the byline stripped it. The last
 * saver is the newest revision's author (a revision row is written by the
 * save that replaced it, under that saver's id); a document with no history
 * falls back to its author. When that person is unknown — deleted, or never
 * matched on import — nothing proves a non-admin wrote the script, so the
 * document is left alone. Every document changed gets a revision first, so
 * the stripped version can be restored from History.
