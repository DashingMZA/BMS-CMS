//
// Three files had grown the same expression —
// `(settings.site_url || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || "")` — and all
// three quietly produced `""` on a deployment where neither is set. That empty
// string is not a harmless default:
//
//   • the sitemap emitted `<loc>/rehan1</loc>`, and `<loc>` must be absolute,
//     so search engines reject the whole file;
//   • the feed emitted `<link>/rehan1</link>` and a relative `<guid>`, which no
//     reader can resolve;
//   • robots.txt silently dropped its `Sitemap:` line, so nothing pointed at
//     the sitemap either.
//
// The next failure mode was worse: an empty setting plus a host that only
// has AUTH_URL / NEXTAUTH_URL (the login address, always set in production)
// fell through to `http://localhost:3000`. Sitemap, robots, feed and llms.txt
// are built at request time, so they published localhost while prerendered
// pages (canonical, og:url) still looked fine. Skip loopback whenever a
// public address exists.
