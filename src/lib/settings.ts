// Nine files had grown their own copy of this query, and a single page render
// runs several of them: the root layout's metadata, the page's own metadata,
// then the page body — each paying a full round trip to Postgres for the same
// rows. Rendering one blog post hit the table four times.
//
// `cache()` is React's per-request memo: the first caller in a render pass does
// the query, the rest get the same promise, and nothing is held between
// requests. That last part is the point — an edit to Appearance shows up on the
// very next request, exactly as before, so this is a pure win with no staleness
// to reason about. Cross-request caching would need invalidation wired into
// every settings write, and is a separate decision.

// A note on what is *not* here, because it was investigated and the obvious

//
// In `next dev`, every value in this map appears in the HTML of every page: a
// canary setting showed up on `/`, `/blog`, a post and an author page. That
// looks exactly like a settings leak across a client boundary — `HeaderZone`
// receives this map and is rendered as children of `OffCanvas`, which is a
// client component.
//
// It is not. The value appears in React's *owner/debug* slot, which development
// builds attach to server-component elements. A production build was checked
// with the same canaries and emits neither: 0 occurrences on all four pages.
// No filtering is applied here, because a filter that silently dropped keys
// would be a real failure mode traded for an imaginary one.
//
// The standing rule is unchanged and does not depend on any of that:
// credentials belong in environment variables, never in this table.
