/**
 * What a session is bound to besides the user id.
 *
 * Sessions are JWTs, which the server never stores — so changing a password
 * used to leave every existing session valid until it expired on its own. A
 * cookie stolen before the change kept working after it, which is the one
 * moment a person most expects it to stop. The token now carries the tail of
 * the password hash it was issued against; `auth()` compares it with the
 * database (at most once every five minutes per session, so it is not a
 * query on every request) and drops the session when they differ. A password
 * change is therefore a sign-out everywhere within five minutes — except for
 * the browser that made the change, which the users route refreshes with the
 * new value.
