// Choosing text that can be read on a colour the owner picked.
//
// The theme used to write `color:#fff` next to every
// `background:var(--color-primary)`. That is correct for a dark brand colour
// and invisible for a light one — and nothing stopped anyone picking a light
// one. a live site set `--color-primary: #ffffff`, which made the generic
// `.btn` and `.bmsbtn.is-fill` white on white: the 404 page's "بحث" and
// "العودة إلى الرئيسية" buttons were there, focusable, and could not be seen.
//
// This is a CMS for people who are not going to reason about contrast ratios,
// so the theme works it out. A control whose label cannot be read is the same
// class of problem as a switch that does nothing: the admin did what the
// interface allowed and got something broken.
//
// The maths is WCAG 2.1's relative luminance, the same one the contrast
// checks in the Customizer use. Anything this cannot parse — `rgb()`, a CSS
// variable, a named colour — returns "" so the caller keeps its own default
// rather than guessing.
