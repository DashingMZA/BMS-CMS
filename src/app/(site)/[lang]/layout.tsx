/**
 * The public site's root layout — one per language.
 *
 * `<html lang>` has to name the language of the document, and a layout can only
 * know that if the language is a real route segment. It was not: every route
 * sat under one root layout that could not see the URL, so `/fr` and `/ur` both
 * served `lang="en" dir="ltr"` — wrong for translation, hyphenation and screen
 * readers, and for Urdu it laid a right-to-left language out left-to-right.
 *
 * So the language is a segment now, and the middleware rewrites public URLs
 * onto it: `/about` → `/en/about`, while `/fr/about` already matches. The
 * address bar is untouched — the default language stays unprefixed — and
 * because `lang` is a param rather than a header, every page still prerenders.
 *
 * The admin has its own root layout under `(admin)`, which is why there is no
 * `app/layout.tsx` any more: two root layouts, one per area.
