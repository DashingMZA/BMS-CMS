// current browser does not need them, and reports about 11 KiB of "legacy
// JavaScript". It is an unscored insight: it costs no download a modern
// browser would not have made anyway, and a millisecond or two of parse.
//
// It is dropped by default. An earlier note here said Next's own App Router
// calls `Object.hasOwn` and `URL.canParse`, so removing the shims would blank
// the page on older iPhones. Checked against a real build (2026-09-21): in
// every client chunk those names appear only where a polyfill defines them —
// this module, and Next's separate `polyfills-*.js`, which is `nomodule` and
// never loaded by a modern browser. Nothing calls them, nor `.at()` or the
// trim methods. What the code does call (`Object.fromEntries`, `flatMap`,
// `Promise.finally`) has been in Safari since 12 and Chrome since 73, the
// oldest browsers Next targets anyway. If a future Next or a new dependency
// starts relying on one of them, LEGACY_POLYFILLS=on puts the module back;
// re-run the grep (`grep -ohE ".{30}(hasOwn|canParse).{30}" -r .next/static/chunks`)
